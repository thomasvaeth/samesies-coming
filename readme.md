# Coming Soon template
### About
I needed to make templates to add to a store for my final project at General Assembly, [Samesies](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-samesies). This one is a free template for websites that need a coming soon landing page.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* jQuery.countdown
* ajaxChimp

### How to Make Changes
* Add your MailChimp to the signup form
  - You need to replace URL in js/coming.js on line 7 with your URL. How do you get the URL? The way I do it is go to Lists, the list you want to use, and then signup form. There will be a list of general forms. Click Embedded Forms. On line 9 of the copy/paste field you will see something saying <form action="" and you want copy the link in those quotes.
* Add your links to the social media icons
  - In index.hmtl just replace the # in <a href="#" with your URL.
