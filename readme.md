# Coming Soon template
### About
I needed to make templates to add to a store for my final project at General Assembly, [Samesies](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-samesies). This one is a free template for websites that need a coming soon landing page.

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome
* jQuery.countdown
* ajaxChimp

### How to Make Changes
* Change the calendar
  - You need to change the date on line 2 in js/coming.js.
* Add your MailChimp to the signup form
  - You need to replace URL in js/coming.js on line 7 with your URL. How do you get the URL? The way I do it is go to Lists, the list you want to use, and then signup form. There will be a list of general forms. Click Embedded Forms. On line 9 of the copy/paste field you will see something saying <form action="" and you want copy the link in those quotes.
* Add your links to the social media icons
  - In index.html just replace the # in <a href="#" with your URL.
* Change background linear gradient
  - The linear gradient is in css/main.css on line 8 and 9. A great website for gradient colors is [uiGradients](http://uigradients.com/). Just replace the hex values with the ones you want.
* Change fonts
  - [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) has fonts available to use for free. Google does a great job explaining how to add them to your website and you would just have to change the ones that are already in css/main.css.
* Change title and favicon
	- The title is in index.html on line 8. 
	- Favicon is the picture that shows up on the tabs next to the title and is in index.html on line 9. There are favicon generator websites where you can drag in a regular picture and it turns it into a favicon. Just save it in images folder and direct it there.
